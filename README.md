## Credits
- Frontend Developer:Dhivyarackshana (Landing page, form UI, validation, dashboard)

## Project Overview
SkillSwap is a web application designed to help students share knowledge through peer-to-peer micro-tutoring sessions.  
This project was developed as part of (INFR3120 – Web and Scripting - Fall 2025), Group 48.

The platform allows users to:
- Create skill sessions with details such as title, description, duration, offered by, and availability.
- View active sessions in a dashboard table.
- Manage sessions with basic Create and Delete functionality (Edit placeholder included).
- Prepare for backend integration to enable full CRUD operations.

## Frontend Contribution (Dhivyarackshana)
As the "frontend developer", my responsibilities included:

  Landing Page (Step 5.1):
  - Added site name "SkillSwap" and team logo.
  - Included tagline: *Peer-to-peer micro-tutoring for students*.

  Hero Button + Form UI (Step 5.2):
  - Implemented a hero button labeled *Create Skill Session*.
  - Built a form with required fields: Title, Description, Duration, Offered By, Availability.

  Frontend Logic + Validation (Step 5.3):
  - Added JavaScript to toggle form visibility.
  - Implemented input validation to ensure all fields are filled.
  - Added confirmation popup (“Are you sure you want to submit this session?”).
  - Reset and hide form after submission.

  Dashboard/Table View (Step 5.4):
  - Created a table to display active skill sessions.
  - Added "Delete" functionality (frontend only).
  - Added "Edit" placeholder (to be connected to backend later).

## Tools & Technologies
- HTML5 – Structure of the web pages
- CSS3 – Styling and layout
- JavaScript (ES6) – Interactivity, validation, and dashboard logic
- GitHub – Version control and collaboration

## Learning Resources
During development, I referred to:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) – for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax examples
- YouTube tutorials – for practical demonstrations of form validation and CRUD logic
- Various developer blogs and websites – for best practices in frontend design and table management

## Next Steps
- Backend Integration (Member 2):
  - Connect form submission to Node.js/Express backend.
  - Implement full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - Deploy project to a cloud service (Render, Vercel, or Netlify).

- Demo Video (Step 7):
  - Show landing page, hero button, form submission, and dashboard functionality.
  - Explain frontend code with comments for clarity.
